This tool will let you generate code for new creatures by answering questions.
When the questions are completed, you may view your code.
Then you can add your code to creatures.txt
Finally, you can load your code into player_creatures.txt so that you can play your new creature as a keeper or adventurer.
You will see it appear as both an adventurer and keeper when you start a game.
You will need to select "Alpha28ModdingToolKit" as the current mod in the keeperRL settings in-game.
