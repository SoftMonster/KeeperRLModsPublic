Dear reader,

In KeeperRL, modding the software is achieved by making sprites and changing the game configuration.The configuration settings for this mod are located at:

https://github.com/SoftMonster/KeeperRLModsPublic

The rights you have regarding this software configuration are found in COPYING.txt

https://github.com/SoftMonster/KeeperRLModsPublic/blob/master/Alpha30/Alpha30Bonus/COPYING.txt

Note that the configuration files in Git are branched from the vanilla configuration files and for that reason, they must remain under the GNU General Public License.

I will not put any tiles or graphics into GitHub because in many cases the tiles have a complicated history with licensing (eg. modified stock graphics) and are therefore, not under GNU. The tiles must be downloaded in-game and are not necessarily distributable outside specific conditions.

So, this mod is expected to be available in-game as a download.
The in-game version will contain any new graphic tiles that are required.
The mod will have ongoing updates, which will require it to be re-downloaded once a new thing comes out.

Thanks for your understanding.

The mod can be discussed on Steam here:

Enjoy the mod!
